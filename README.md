# Pi Estimation Project


## Description

The `pi_estimation.ipynb` file contains an interactive implementation that visually demonstrates the estimation of π using the Monte Carlo method (random sampling).  
There is also an exported .html version.

## Features

- Visual representation of random point generation inside a square and a circle.
- Estimation of π value based on the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points.
- Interactive plot

## How to Use

1. Open the `pi_estimation.html` file in a browser or see directly in a notebook on github
